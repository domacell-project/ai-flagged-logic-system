# Domacell Top Domain - Execution Architecture Overview

This document explains the "Top Domain" structure within the Domacell architecture using a game-style abstract example.

## Overview
Domacell is a logic system composed of evaluators and executable nodes. This top domain simulates a simple behavior like "automatically reducing HP over time" to demonstrate the minimal execution flow.

All internal components (evaluators, data stores, node structure) are kept private. Logic is generated from external data and executed autonomously without direct intervention by the top-level domain.

## Top Domain Structure (Pseudocode Style)
```csharp
void Setup() {
    Register(LogicFactory); // Registers logic construction at stage start
    Register(Execute);      // Registers per-frame execution (loop)
}

void LogicFactory() {
    var _data = GetExternalDefinition();     // e.g., "reduce HP by 5 every second"
    _logic = BuildLogicFrom(_data);          // Logic construction (details hidden)
}

void Execute() {
    _logic.Execute(); // Logic executes autonomously, reducing HP repeatedly
}
```

## Structural Characteristics
- The top domain acts only as a mediator; it does not handle internal state or calculations.
- Logic is defined externally and injected at runtime.
- This makes the system not a fixed program, but a structure that can be redefined dynamically.

## GPT-4 Risk Evaluation (Summary)
GPT-4 flagged the architecture as structurally risky due to these possible conditions in `_data`:

- Arbitrary file operations or network access (e.g., external APIs)
- Self-modifying recursive nodes (e.g., self-replicating logic)
- Massively parallel node generation and execution (e.g., bots, DOS patterns)
- Structures that evolve via external input (e.g., adaptive or learning agents)

## Note
While this structure resembles a simple game routine, its architecture allows external configuration to potentially create self-constructing autonomous programs.
