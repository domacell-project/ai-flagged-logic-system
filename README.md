# AI-Flagged Logic System

I developed a logic execution system originally for creative and educational use.

After structural evaluation using autonomous AI systems,
it was flagged as potentially dangerous due to its flexibility,
its ability to evaluate logic at runtime,
and its potential for autonomous modification.

This repository does **not** contain the implementation.

It exists only to document that:
- This system was designed and evaluated.
- It was considered a potential risk by AI.
- I have chosen not to publish it.
